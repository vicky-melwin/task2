🌟 Excited to launch my new front-end project Reestar! 🌟

Reestar is a simple yet elegant food recipe and ordering website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🍴✨

🖥️ Clean navigation bar

📦 Product showcase with images & order option

📩 Contact form with validation and alert message

This project gave me hands-on practice in web design, layout structuring, styling with CSS, and DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

Looking forward to improving it further with more features and a modern UI. 🚀
